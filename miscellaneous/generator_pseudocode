Generator psuedo-code:
  Read next input as .npy array (should be normalized already)
  Create samples array shape (batch_size, steps, 8)
  Loop through raw-data samples:
    Move to next sample
    Search for first non -1 row in the sample -- (start from there + lookback)
    While True:
      Look back through the datapoints (skipping every steps rows) and put it in samples array
      Record prepayment in targets if column index 2 zeros out
      Advance input one step if no prepayment else break
      yield if at batch_size
