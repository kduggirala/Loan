Metrics used:
  1. Loan age from Fannie Mae
  2. Difference between current interest rate and loan interest rate from Fannie Mae
  3. Original Loan to Value from Fannie Mae
  4. Monthly Unemployment Rate (by metropolitan statistical area) from BLS
  5. Monthly Housing Price (by first three numbers of the zip code) from zillow
  6. Annual Personal Income (by first three numbers of the zip code) from BEA
  7. Annual Population (by first three numbers of the zip code) from BEA

Data normalized (subtracting mean, dividing out standard deviation with numpy)
1,280,000 records used to train the network (~500k loans):
  Each record starts at a month and moves five time steps lookforward
    Each time step records every other month
  Predicts prepayment exactly one year from start month

Model Used (model6):
  Keras Sequential model:
    Two LSTM Layers (Neuron count: 32)
    One Output Dense Layer with sigmoid activation (Neuron count: 1)
  Batch size = 128
  Dropout = 0.2
  Recurrent dropout = 0.2
  Steps per epoch = 10000

Trained with: AWS EC2 g4dn.2xlarge

models:
  model 5: batch_size = 128, dropout = 0.2 --> ~96-97% acc
  model 7: batch_size = 256, dropout = 0.2 --> ~94-95% acc (~97% on 2003, overfitted to 2003 data?)
  model 8: batch_size = 512, dropout = 0.2 --> ~97.1 acc (during training ranged btwn 91-99% acc; seems to be wild dissonance between pre and post 2008, jumping point for further research?)
  model 2009: batch_size = 512, dropout = 0.2 --> 97.5% acc (post-2008 data to train, not fully consistent, maybe hypothesis inccorect?)
